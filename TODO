- explain because we obtain some type of prediction using a given classifier
- make a plot like "The Bias-Variance trade-off"

- experiments for embeddings phase


- for a single phase of the pipeline compare different recommendation model

- one metric for each plot


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- experiments for observation phase [OK]

- for each recommendation model show performance in each step of the pipeline [OK]

- plot
    - validation curve: show overfitting [OK]
    - learning curve:
