- explain because we obtain some type of prediction using a given classifier
- make a plot like "The Bias-Variance trade-off"

- experiments for observation phase
- experiments for embeddings phase

- for each recommendation model show performance in each step of the pipeline
- for a single phase of the pipeline compare different recommendation model

- one metric for each plot

- plot
    - validation curve: show overfitting
    - learning curve:


- experiments on embeddings
